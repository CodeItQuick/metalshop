			p At home you have unlimited time. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.
			p We can fix anything. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Let that brush dance around there and play.
			p You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. This is the fun part That easy.
			p Let's get wild today. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's build an almighty mountain. That's crazy. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?
			p By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Get tough with it, get strong. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue
			p It's important to me that you're happy. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.
			p We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. See there how easy that is. Let your imagination be your guide. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.
			p Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. We'll put a happy little sky in here. We'll make some happy little bushes here.
			p Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. With practice comes confidence. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. You can do it.
			p See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.
			p Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.
			p Just beat the devil out of it. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We have a fantastic little sky! The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.
			p Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Anything you want to do you can do here. Those great big fluffy clouds.
			p If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Don't fiddle with it all day.
			p Every day I learn. Anyone can paint. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.
			p If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Use what you see, don't plan it. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.
			p Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. There we go. It all happens automatically.
			p Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Just a little indication. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Little short strokes. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
			p Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. There he comes. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.
			p The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. In this world, everything can be happy. Let's do it again then, what the heck.
			p The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife.
			p Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. In your world you can create anything you desire. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.
			p Here we're limited by the time we have. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.
			p Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. It's all a game of angles. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.
			p We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.
			p Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You can create anything that makes you happy. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Very easy to work these to death.
			p Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. A beautiful little sunset.
			p There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. A happy cloud. Imagination is the key to painting.
			p Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Let's do that again. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.
			p This is unplanned it really just happens. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.
			p In your world you have total and absolute power. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. You're meant to have fun in life.
			p I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We don't have anything but happy trees here. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
			p Working it up and down, back and forth. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. What the devil. The light is your friend. Preserve it.
			p Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You can get away with a lot. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.
			p There we are. In life you need colors. We'll play with clouds today. Trees grow however makes them happy. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.
			p Work that paint. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.
			p Put it in, leave it alone. A fan brush can be your best friend. You gotta think like a tree. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.
			p This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.
			p Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Son of a gun. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Use your imagination, let it go.
			p Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All those little son of a guns.
			p That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Isn't that fantastic?
			p And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.
			p Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's get crazy.
			p We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Let the paint work.
			p Do an almighty painting with us. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Look at them little rascals.
			p That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.
			p Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Mountains are so simple, they're hard.
			p You are only limited by your imagination. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.
			p It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. This is a fantastic little painting.
			p Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
